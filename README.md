Projects and workflows from my Machine Learning Internships at Beacon and Deepcept AI

---

## 1. BEACON - Machine Learning Intern

### ðŸŒŸ Featured Projects:

1.  **Lead Lifecycle Dashboard with Prediction and Prioritization:**
    * **Objective:** Developed a smart Streamlit dashboard to visualize the lead lifecycle, predict lead closure timelines using a HistGradientBoostingRegressor, and prioritize open leads based on conversion probability using a RandomForestClassifier.
    * **Impact:** Prioritized high-conversion leads and delivered actionable sales insights.
    * **Skills:** Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Feature Engineering (temporal/categorical), Regression, Classification, Data Visualization.
    * **Code:** [`Beacon_ML_Internship/lead_dashboard.py`](./Beacon_ML_Internship/lead_dashboard.py) (Requires `lead_data.csv`)

2.  **Web Scraping of Startup Mahakumbh Exhibitor Directory:**
    * **Objective:** Built an automated web scraper using Python, cloudscraper, and BeautifulSoup to extract contact details from the exhibitor directory.
    * **Impact:** Enabled mass outreach to over 500 organizations, saving significant manual effort for the marketing team.
    * **Skills:** Python, cloudscraper, BeautifulSoup, Dynamic Pagination Handling, Data Automation.
    * **Code:** [`Beacon_ML_Internship/startup_mahakumbh_scraper.py`](./Beacon_ML_Internship/startup_mahakumbh_scraper.py)

    

## 2. Deepcept AI - Software Engineering Intern

### ðŸ“š Learning & Implementation Highlights:

This internship focused on strengthening my core foundation through guided implementation notebooks across key AI domains:

* **Computer Vision (CV):** Implemented classification models for Dog vs. Cat and Dog Breed Identification using CNNs and Deep Learning (DL).
* **NLP & Transformers:** Explored the basics of NLP and worked through key concepts of Transformer models for sequence tasks.
* **Deep Learning Fundamentals:** Studied and implemented core architectures like GAN basics and Autoencoders to understand generation and dimensionality reduction.
* **Core Tech Stack:** Brush-up on Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Linux usage.
