## 1. BEACON - Machine Learning Intern

[cite_start]**Duration:** March 2025 ‚Äì June 2024 (3 Months) [cite: 3]

[cite_start]**Team:** Digital Transformation (DTX) [cite: 4]

**Focus:** Predictive Analytics, Data Workflow Automation, and Sales Enablement.

### üåü Featured Projects:

1.  **Lead Lifecycle Dashboard with Prediction and Prioritization:**
    * [cite_start]**Objective:** Developed a smart **Streamlit dashboard** to visualize the lead lifecycle, predict lead closure timelines using a **HistGradientBoostingRegressor**, and prioritize open leads based on conversion probability using a **RandomForestClassifier**[cite: 99, 108, 109].
    * [cite_start]**Impact:** Prioritized high-conversion leads and delivered actionable sales insights[cite: 163].
    * **Skills:** Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Feature Engineering (temporal/categorical), Regression, Classification, Data Visualization.
    * **Code:** [`Beacon_ML_Internship/lead_dashboard.py`](./Beacon_ML_Internship/lead_dashboard.py) (Requires `lead_data.csv`)

2.  **Web Scraping of Startup Mahakumbh Exhibitor Directory:**
    * [cite_start]**Objective:** Built an automated **web scraper** using **Python, cloudscraper, and BeautifulSoup** to extract contact details from the exhibitor directory[cite: 8, 9, 10].
    * [cite_start]**Impact:** Enabled mass outreach to over 500 organizations, saving significant manual effort for the marketing team[cite: 15, 16].
    * **Skills:** Python, cloudscraper, BeautifulSoup, Dynamic Pagination Handling, Data Automation.
    * **Code:** [`Beacon_ML_Internship/startup_mahakumbh_scraper.py`](./Beacon_ML_Internship/startup_mahakumbh_scraper.py)

## 2. Deepcept AI - Software Engineering Intern

**Duration:** June 2024 ‚Äì January 2025

**Focus:** Technical Skill Brush-up and Foundational Deep Learning/AI Concept Development.

### üìö Learning & Implementation Highlights:

This internship focused on strengthening my core foundation through guided implementation notebooks across key AI domains:

* **Computer Vision (CV):** Implemented classification models for **Dog vs. Cat** and **Dog Breed Identification** using **CNNs** and **Deep Learning** (DL).
* **NLP & Transformers:** Explored the basics of **NLP** and worked through key concepts of **Transformer** models for sequence tasks.
* **Deep Learning Fundamentals:** Studied and implemented core architectures like **GAN basics** and **Autoencoders** to understand generation and dimensionality reduction.
* **Core Tech Stack:** Brush-up on **Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Linux** usage.
